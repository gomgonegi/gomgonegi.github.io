/* Decode the next character, C, from BUF, reporting errors in E.
 *
 * Since this is a branchless decoder, four bytes will be read from the
 * buffer regardless of the actual length of the next character. This
 * means the buffer _must_ have at least three bytes of zero padding
 * following the end of the data stream.
 *
 * Errors are reported in E, which will be non-zero if the parsed
 * character was somehow invalid: invalid byte sequence, non-canonical
 * encoding, or a surrogate half.
 *
 * The function returns a pointer to the next character. When an error
 * occurs, this pointer will be a guess that depends on the particular
 * error, but it will always advance at least one byte.
